You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. To add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works. Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: def print_hi(name) puts \"Hi, #{name}\" end print_hi('Tom') #=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT. Check out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyll’s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk."

The MonoAlg3D is a program for solving the 3D monodomain model. It is given by a reaction-diffusion equation and is numeracally solved by applying the Finite Volume Method. The program is implemented in C and maintained by the FISIOCOMP research group. A main advantage of the solver is that not only is able to solve the monodomain equations and simulate the action potential propagation in heterogeneous tissue using both the CPU and GPU computing power but can also handle non-uniform and non-conforming adaptive meshes. In particular my role in this project was to implement all the functions that enables the coupling of the Purkinje fibers in the ventricular tissue. The Purkinje fibers are basically the structure in the cardiac conduction system which are responsible for stimulating the ventricular cells in endocardium. Monodomain model: $$ \\\\beta C_m \\\\dfrac\\\\partial V_m \\\\partial t + \\\\beta I_ion (V_m ,\\\\eta) = \\ abla . (\\\\sigma \\ abla V_m ) + I_stim $$ $$ \\\\dfrac\\\\partial \\\\eta \\\\partial t = f(V_m ,\\\\eta). $$ <div class=\\ col s12 tag-div\\ > <div class=\\ center\\ > <video width=\\ 640\\ height=\\ 480\\ controls> <source src=\\ /assets/img/projects/vid/plain_mesh_spiral_comparison.mp4\\ type=\\ video/mp4\\ > Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>A simulation solved by the MonoAlg3D program which compares a normal tissue activation and what happens in a cardiac arrhythmia scenario.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\\ col s12 tag-div\\ > <div class=\\ center\\ > <video width=\\ 640\\ height=\\ 480\\ controls> <source src=\\ /assets/img/projects/vid/purkinje_fibrosis_and_ischemia.mp4\\ type=\\ video/mp4\\ > Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>Simulation showing a cardiac arrhythmia generated by micro-reentries near an ischemic region.

The Shocker is a program for generating Purkinje networks (PN) in any type of endocardium surface which was implemented by me during my Phd. The Purkinje network is part of the Cardiac Conduction System (CCS) and is responsible for activating the ventricular walls in synchronous manner. To generate a Purkinje network the input data of the method is the following: an endocardium surface a proximal location for the root branch which must be within the endocardium surface. In addition the user can supply a set of active Purkinje-Ventricular-Muscles (PVJs) with their respective coordinates and Local Activation Time (LAT). In this scenario the Shocker method will try to connect the given active PVJs close to their reference LAT using optimization principles. Furthermore another feature of the Shocker program is that the user can also pass an initial configuration for the Purkinje network. This way well-known structures of the Purkinje system like the Left-Bundle-Branch (LBB) and Right-Bundle-Branch (RBB) can be constructed beforehand using different techniques and be supplied as the initial network in order to provide better guidance of the regions that the PN certainly will occupy based on physiological observations. The second advantage of this feature is extending an already constructed PN by including different branches on its topology. For instance these PNs could come as the output of another method already available in the literature. Thus the user could want to increase its endocardium coverage or connect additional PVJs points which is a feature that the available methods to generate PN in the literature currently do not have implemented. <div class=\\ col s12 tag-div\\ > <div class=\\ center\\ > <video width=\\ 640\\ height=\\ 480\\ controls> <source src=\\ /assets/img/projects/vid/shocker_algorithm_summary_finsberg_LV.mp4\\ type=\\ video/mp4\\ > Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>Purkinje network growing in a left ventricle endocardium surface with the Shocker program.</p> </div> </div> The PN generated by the Shocker program were constructed in such way that they can be used alongside the MonoAlg3D program in cardiac simulations. Here are a few MonoAlg3D simulations executed with different types of Purkinje networks generated by the Shocker program. The endocardium surfaces have an increasing level of complexity. <div class=\\ col s12 tag-div\\ > <div class=\\ center\\ > <video width=\\ 640\\ height=\\ 480\\ controls> <source src=\\ /assets/img/projects/vid/shocker_monoalg_finsberg_ref_best_worst.mp4\\ type=\\ video/mp4\\ > Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>MonoAlg3D simulations with different Purkinje networks considering a <b>Simplified biventricular mesh</b>.</p> <p>On the left side of the video a reference Purkinje network is given and activates both ventricles. </p> <p>In the middle and right panels two Purkinje networks generated by the Shocker program where one have a good accuracy in connecting the active PVJs from the reference Purkinje network.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\\ col s12 tag-div\\ > <div class=\\ center\\ > <video width=\\ 640\\ height=\\ 480\\ controls> <source src=\\ /assets/img/projects/vid/shocker_monoalg_canine_ref_best_worst.mp4\\ type=\\ video/mp4\\ > Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>MonoAlg3D simulations with different Purkinje networks considering a <b>Canine biventricular mesh</b>.</p> <p>On the left side of the video a reference Purkinje network is given and activates both ventricles. </p> <p>In the middle and right panels two Purkinje networks generated by the Shocker program where one have a good accuracy in connecting the active PVJs from the reference Purkinje network.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\\ col s12 tag-div\\ > <div class=\\ center\\ > <video width=\\ 640\\ height=\\ 480\\ controls> <source src=\\ /assets/img/projects/vid/shocker_monoalg_sebastian_ref_best_worst.mp4\\ type=\\ video/mp4\\ > Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>MonoAlg3D simulations with different Purkinje networks considering a <b>Patient-specific biventricular mesh</b>.</p> <p>On the left side of the video inferred active PVJs activates both ventricles. </p> <p>In the middle and right panels two Purkinje networks generated by the Shocker program where one have a good accuracy in connecting the active PVJs from the reference Purkinje network.</p> </div> </div>"

    ,"content"  : "Hello, my name is Lucas Berg. I am a brazilian researcher with a PhD in Computational Modeling by the Federal University of Juiz de Fora. During my career, I work in different research projects related to cardiac electrophysiology. My major interest is High Performance Computing (HPC) and I believe that software development in this area can really improve our world by reducing the ammount of time spent on solving complex problems. In addition, for me learning programming is something that everyone should know, especially nowadays where almost everything depends on some kind of software to work. Programming is not only important to understand our connected world, but also helps us in improving our problem solving techniques. Because of that, I always try to pass my knowledge to someone who is facing a similar problem that I already been through. I reckon that helping other people either by teaching them about how to use a new technology or by giving suggestions on how to tackle a problem can be a motivation for not giving up, especially in this field ."
